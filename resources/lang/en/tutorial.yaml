route.tutorial.first_use_item: "üí≠: You find yourself in a üåè*planet* unknown to you, rather battered.\nYou immediately check if in your üéí*inventory* there's something to recover some energy...\n\nüìñ *Items:*\nBy accessing at your inventory you'll have the opportunity to use items you crafted or that you found. These üî©*items* are divided in different categories, it's your choice to choose which one to benefit from."
route.tutorial.first_exploration: "üí≠: You get up and by looking towards your ship (not totally intact) you consider trying a search exploration in the zone.\n\nüìñ *Exploration:*\nIt's one of the fastest methods to find resources for crafting and upgrades for you and your equipment. You land on a planet's surface to retrieve various materials based on the planet's biome."
route.tutorial.first_weapon_equipped: "üí≠: You look around, don't feel secure, by checking better in your inventory you noticed that you have a small weapon, necessary to oppose to possible enemies that patrol the surrounding area.\n\nüìñ *Equipment:*\nUpgrading always your equipment of weapons and armors will help you defeat high level enemies, giving you access to bigger treasures."
route.tutorial.first_hunting: "üí≠: You equip the weapon and muster the courage, you then decide to explore the surrounding area.\n\nüìñ *Hunting:*\nIt's a profitable activity that lets you deal with different enemies to collect experience and money!\nObviously if you die... well you die... be careful!\n\n‚ö†Ô∏è *Attention*:\nBased on the mob's rarity, the latter will make more damage!"
route.tutorial.first_travel: "üí≠: You return from the hunt still in a bad shape due to the battles but satisfied.\nYou decide to get back in the ship and you notice that the *Scanner* has detected a *Secure Planet*.\nYou then decide to set the coordinates and to turn on the engines to run away from the hostile environment of uncivilised planets.\n\nüìñ *Travels:*\nTravel and explore the different planets that the universe makes you available.\n\nTake attention to the fuel and your ship... you could find yourself stuck on a hostile planet.\n"
